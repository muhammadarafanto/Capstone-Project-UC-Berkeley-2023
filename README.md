Hi, this project is the university's Industrial Engineering and Operations Research capstone project from UC Berkeley
We partnered with GIG Car Share, a startup carsharing company that is headquartered in Berkeley and have a scope of operations within the San Francisco Bay Area.

The objective of the project is to devise an incentive program to encourage members to refuel the cars. this incentive program will solve the ongoing issue, at the time, of GIG cars not fueled up when not in use.
Additionally, GIG won't have to hire vendors to do the refueling which will ultimately reduce operational cost.
The performance metric that was used for our evaluation was the average daily profit.
Data was provided by GIG and analyzed by our team and used in our simulation which resulted in an increase of 10.8% in the average daily profit.

Skills demonstrated in this notebook are Python, Numpy, Pandas, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
